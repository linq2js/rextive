# ⚠️ PACKAGE DEPRECATED

This package has been **archived** and is **no longer maintained**.

## Use `rextive` Instead

This package has been superseded by **[rextive](../../packages/rextive)**, which offers:

- ✅ Better performance with explicit dependency tracking
- ✅ Improved TypeScript support
- ✅ Cleaner API design
- ✅ Active development and maintenance

## Migration

```bash
# Remove rxblox
npm uninstall rxblox

# Install rextive
npm install rextive
```

## Why This Package Was Archived

The `rxblox` package has been moved to the `archived/` directory because:

1. **Superseded by rextive:** All functionality is available in the newer, better-designed `rextive` package
2. **No longer maintained:** Bug fixes and features are only added to `rextive`
3. **Breaking changes:** The lessons learned from rxblox led to a cleaner API in rextive

## Need Help?

- See [rextive documentation](../../packages/rextive/README.md)
- Open an issue if you need migration assistance
- The archived code remains available for reference
